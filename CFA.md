#### Objectives (High Level Commands)

For CFA Level 1, we have below high level goals

- [ ] Identify one or more definitive reference sources that we can just read through and practice through; This is the most important step for us and completion of such material is of paramount utility
- [ ] Just read through ALL the materials, twice or thrice if time permits
- [ ] Somehow keep one ginantic monothic local copy of all the materials we have studied for future reference purpose
- [ ] Make summary notes of main points I find useful - this step is NOT necessary if we can complete step 1 and 2 because in that case we will already know where to find information we need
- [ ] Define clear knowledge reference structure or note structure for CFA related materials collected for personal reference/review purpose, define NFMS locations for hands-on practice items (including codes, work outs, and formulas) as digital files
- [ ] Make interactive items on https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Investment/CFFEMTI for showcase, using Streamlit or Observable as platform

The official recommended 300 hours and 1000 practice problems are impossible to track and meaningless to track so we won't bother.

#### FAQ: What does CFA entail?

Tags: Question, FAQ

What does it mean to take CFA, what does it entail? What's a source that describes what exactly needs to be learnt? What defines its scope and depth? Is there a single book upon finish which one would have acquired all the knowledge there is to learn about this subject?

#### Exam Style Changes

As of 2023-12-04:

* There are two practical skills module: 1) Financial modeling, 2) Python programming fundamentals.

#### Instructions

Dedicated repo and notes? There are paid notebooks and videos, we could do better. Stick to topics. Target comprehension and exhaustiveness especially when it comes to deep sophistication - how can we deal with structuring that (like large scale software)? What's more, jump out of the complexity minfset and focus on the simple ones - lile simple programming needs: basic static investment strategies instead of active and highly optimizrd.

Sources: Textbook, Practice questions, exam pools. If registered there is online learning ecosystem.

If the key is just to spend time and absorb knowledge, then for our website, it's function should target Reference and Utility (combining data and tools). Notice even bonds can be traded by inviduals using ETF.

Combine and manage under Charles-Zhang-Investment.
Combine Streamlit and Observable?
Provide free signal and free data dashboards based on free platforms for free, hosted on static websites and do not concern user data storage.
Use LLM based topic/keyword extraction from PDF.
