### Investment Notes Ideas

* (Resources) AQR Capital Momentum trading published papers (Dildar knows a lot on this)
* (Practice, #20231216, !Todo) Find next top 10, buy and hold $1000, prepare a spreadsheet to do bookkeeping for now. Our current strategy is buy and hold 1yr never sell except when making big gains. Risk aversion that is. In general, we just never sell. The difference from previous naive approach is we are NOT selling immediately it hits +0%, rather holding either it's high enough percentage gain, or its 1yr. Â¶Notice the behavior is well defined, and we should look up the latest top 10 movers over the past 15 days before making buy/sell orders.
